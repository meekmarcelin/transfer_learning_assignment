# transfer_learning_assignment
## Description

This assignment focuses on applying transfer learning techniques to a problem related to the classification of fruits and vegetables. The objective is to leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them for mission-specific tasks, thereby reducing training time and improving performance.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this task is the "fruits&veges" dataset. It contains images of various fruits and vegetables organized into different classes. Each class represents a specific type of fruit or vegetable, and the task is to classify images into these categories.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the fine-tuned models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples.
- **Loss**: The value of the loss function used during training, indicating how well the model is performing.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

## Findings and Discussion

The experiments involved fine-tuning three pre-trained models: VGG, ResNet, and [Model 3]. Each model was trained on the "fruits&veges" dataset using transfer learning techniques.



### ResNet

- **Accuracy**: []
- **Loss**: []
- **Precision**: []

#### Strengths of Transfer Learning:

- Transfer learning significantly reduces training time by leveraging pre-trained models.
- It allows for better generalization to new datasets, especially when the original dataset is large and diverse.
- Transfer learning enables the application of state-of-the-art models to new tasks with limited annotated data.

#### Limitations of Transfer Learning:

- Transfer learning may not perform well when the pre-trained model is not sufficiently similar to the new task.
- Fine-tuning requires careful selection of hyperparameters and tuning to prevent overfitting or underfitting.
- The choice of pre-trained models and the amount of data available for fine-tuning can greatly impact performance.
